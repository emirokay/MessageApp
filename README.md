# MessageApp
Real-Time iOS Messaging Application

## Overview
This project is a real-time iOS messaging application, developed as part of my university thesis to address communication challenges between teachers and parents. Inspired by modern messaging platforms, the application allows seamless communication through text and image sharing, leveraging Swift, SwiftUI, and Firebase for a smooth and secure user experience.

The primary goal of the project is to improve parental involvement in children's early education by breaking communication barriers with a robust, user-friendly platform.

## Technical Notes:
- The WebImage(url: URL(string: image)).placeholder code in ChatMessageCell.swift has been commented out due to compatibility issues with the current version.
